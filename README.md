# Shader Graph Example Library

![Player Lineup](https://i.imgur.com/kASJxN1.png)

**Description**

This project is a library of different custom shaders created using [Unity 2018.1's Shader Graph feature](https://forum.unity.com/threads/feedback-wanted-shader-graph.511960/). All of the shaders are compatible for the [Lightweight Scriptable Render Pipeline](https://forum.unity.com/threads/feedback-wanted-scriptable-render-pipelines.470095/).

These Shader Graphs are provided as-is; so your mileage may vary! You are more than welcome to modify/change/extract/use any of the examples.


**Sofware Requirement**

Required: Unity 2018.1b3
